# Frontend

This is the frontend component of the End-to-End example for our Amazon practice project. Built with Vue.js and Vite, it serves as the unified panel interface, allowing users to view and interact with the panel URLs by communicating with the backend API service. The application is designed to be simple and user-friendly.
